# Ridge regression for California Housing Dataset


Implementation of gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent
for ridge regression in the toolkit Scikit-Learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).


Used the California Housing Dataset subset available in this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VUn2WKkKeRXwH02K9bqH98KjPxrUmgXh/view?usp=sharing) to demonstrate mine
algorithms. Used appropriate visualization techniques to demonstrate how well my implementations perform on this dataset (more
specifically that they are not underfitting or overfitting). 


### ‼️ If notebook doesn't open in GitHub follow the link [jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Nikoletos-K/Ridge-regression-for-California-Housing-Dataset/blob/main/Ridge_regression_notebook.ipynb) ✔️
